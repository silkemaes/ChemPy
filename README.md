# ChemTorch
Chemical Kinetics code in Python/PyTorch

This is a 0D chemical kinetics code, solving the set of ordinary differental equations (ODEs) that make up the chemical network.

The code is an adaptation of the most basic form of the legacy chemistry codes rate13_dc_code and rate13_cse_code by [UMIST](http://udfa.ajmarkwick.net/index.php?mode=downloads)
