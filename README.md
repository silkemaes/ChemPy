Chemical Kinetics code in Python/PyTorch

---
This is a 0D chemical kinetics code, written in Python3. It solves the set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that make up the chemical network.

The code is based on the legacy chemistry codes by the [UMIST](http://udfa.ajmarkwick.net/index.php?mode=downloads):

- The circumstellar envelope chemical model source code: rate13_cse_code.tgz
