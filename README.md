## ChemTorch
Chemical Kinetics code in Python/PyTorch

---
This is a 0D chemical kinetics code, written in Python3. It solves the set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that make up the chemical network.

The code is based on the legacy chemistry codes by the [UMIST](http://udfa.ajmarkwick.net/index.php?mode=downloads) Database of Astrochemsitry:
- The dark cloud chemical model source code: rate13_dc_code.tgz
- The circumstellar envelope chemical model source code: rate13_cse_code.tgz

Currently still in development!

The purpose is to use this code to generate data to build a chemistry emulator.
